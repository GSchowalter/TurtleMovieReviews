# Work in progress

_Bodies bodies bodies_ is a non stop laugh fest with dynamic characters, relevant humor, and genuine surprises woven into the plot. A24 capitalizes on their success with gen z audiences they have cultivated through Euphoria and nabbing Pete Davidson for a small role helps draw in the crowds even more. From the opening scene I was caught off guard with depth of characters and intense youthful spirit running through every interaction.

Set in a remote mansion during a hurricane. A friend group of rich, family money, young adults get together for a "storm party". We follow Bee, an eastern european immigrant who is there on behalf of her relationship with Sophie who has been estranged from the friend group on account of her recent stint in rehab. In Clue fashion, the friends start to die one by one leading to a cross between murder house thriller and who done it mystery as the friends begin to turn on each other. Horror and jumpscares included!

This movie will have you laughing more than shivering as it unapologetically rips apart the very audience it is geared to. The same crowd who is driven to the theaters by Pete Davidson and the gen z marketing are made the butt of every joke. This movie knows what makes modern humor so great, self deprication!

The ending is surprising to say the least. Definitely leaning more into the humor side of the movie than the thriller. I was a little disappointed by it and felt that it undercut the suspense being built through the film. However the characters and their relationships are what makes this film really worth watching. At its heart this film is an exploration into the jealousy, shame, and judgment that comes with long term friendships. As more and more is revealed about our characters and their lives, the less and less we like them. As they turn on eachother we turn on them, no one is safe.

While this movie certainly wont change your life it will certainly make your week! See it now and join in the discussion.
