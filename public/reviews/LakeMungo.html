  I went on a ghost hunting tour last week. Before embarking on our walk around
  old town Manassas, the guides - two zany new yorkers with a passion for
  chasing ghosts - explained the many definitions of a “ghost”. Ghosts, they
  said, are manifestations of energy. This explained spirits relationally to me,
  As humans, we are naturally full of energy. Where does that energy go after we
  pass? There is likely a scientific explanation for where our energy is
  transferred in death, but for the sake of this review, let’s disregard that.

  <em>Lake Mungo</em> is a chilling film about the effect sudden death can have
  on a family. The film follows the Palmer family after the loss of their
  daughter, Alice, to a drowning accident. Following her death, the family
  begins to experience strange dreams, events, and behaviors, leading them to
  believe their daughter is haunting them. This is about as much as Anderson
  decides to stick to a typical ghost-story narrative. Anderson spends the rest
  of the time venturing further into unsettling secrets that plagued their
  daughter, revealing answers to the family’s questions.

  Though the film leaves some to be desired in terms of individual character
  development, it succeeds in painting a solemn portrait of a family trying to
  cope with deep trauma. Each member of the family comes to terms in different
  ways: the mom nightwalks into homes, the dad hallucinates wildly, and the
  brother [redacted for spoilers]. The family, as a whole, works as a singular
  character that moves the story forward with their hunger for answers. It
  becomes unclear if their haunting is a manifestation of their own mourning, or
  of supernatural forces - which is a typical question in most real life
  hauntings. The film does a great job of answering that question, while leaving
  uncertainty in the true source of their experiences.

  The ghost hunting tour concluded with a clairvoyance test that measured our
  sensitivity to the supernatural - according to our hosts, attempting to
  connect with spirits would enhance ESP capabilities. A card would have 1 of 6
  shapes on its backside - we were asked to meditate briefly to focus, and then
  choose which shape we thought it was. Lake Mungo ends in a similar way, that
  was both chilling and endearing. Looking for spirits is an attempt to bridge
  worlds, and that bridge is often crossed unsuccessfully.
  <em>Lake Mungo</em> ponders the outcome of those worlds coming together
  without a choice, and is a must watch for those who are curious about what
  else is out there.
