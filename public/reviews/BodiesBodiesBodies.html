  Set in a remote mansion during a hurricane. A friend group of rich, family
  money, young adults get together for a 'storm party'. We follow Bee, an
  eastern european immigrant who is there on behalf of her relationship with
  Sophie who has been estranged from the friend group on account of her recent
  stint in rehab. In Clue fashion, the friends start to die one by one leading
  to a cross between murder house thriller and who done it mystery as the
  friends begin to turn on each other. Horror and jumpscares included!

  This movie will have you laughing more than shivering as it unapologetically
  rips apart the very audience it is geared to. The same crowd who is driven to
  the theaters by Pete Davidson and the gen z marketing are made the butt of
  every joke. This movie knows what makes modern humor so great, self
  deprication!

  The ending is surprising to say the least. Definitely leaning more into the
  humor side of the movie than the thriller. I was a little disappointed by it
  and felt that it undercut the suspense being built through the film. However
  the characters and their relationships are what makes this film really worth
  watching. At its heart this film is an exploration into the jealousy, shame,
  and judgment that comes with long term friendships. As more and more is
  revealed about our characters and their lives, the less and less we like them.
  As they turn on eachother we turn on them, no one is safe.

  While this movie certainly wont change your life it will certainly make your
  week! See it now and join in the discussion.
