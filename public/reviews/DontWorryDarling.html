  <em>Don’t Worry Darling</em> was, if not one of the most anticipated films of
  the summer, definitely one of the most publicized. For those not in the know,
  this film was marred by controversy from the start. Shia Lebouf, the original
  male lead, didn’t like Olivia Wilde. Olivia Wilde didn’t like Shia Lebouf.
  Florence Pugh and Olivia Wilde didn’t get along. Olivia Wilde cast Harry
  Styles after cutting Shia LeBouf because they were dating. Harry Styles didn’t
  like Chris Pine. Nick Kroll and Kate Berlant were just happy to be there (both
  of whom have amazing new specials that you should watch!). Did I miss
  anything? Probably. Does it matter for this review? No, although knowing all
  this beforehand was quite distracting while watching.

  <em>Don’t Worry Darling</em> is probably the best 38% rotten tomatoes rated
  movie you will ever see. There are obvious reasons to not enjoy this movie but
  there are just as many to love it. After the credits rolled I was treated to
  the most hesitant round of applause I have ever heard. People went into this
  movie either expecting to hate it or expecting to love it, but sadly both
  camps walked away unsatisfied.

  There are two reasons to watch this movie. First being the visionary
  cinematography of Mathew Libatique and second - Florence Pugh. The plot, the
  dialogue, and the rest of the acting will leave you somewhat underwhelmed. You
  may not know who Mathew Libatique is, but you have no doubt heard of some of
  his past works (<em>A Star is Born, Requiem for a Dream, Black Swan). </em>The
  film was shot in the deserts of beautiful,arid, southern California. If this
  movie was lacking one thing, the budget was not it. You can really see the
  production quality shine in the constructed 1950’s neighborhood. The way
  Libatique is able to contrast the wide angle, open desert shots with cozy pans
  of the cul de sac creates an uncanny sense of isolation. We feel stranded
  along with our main character, Alice, played by Florence Pugh.

  Pugh cements her place as one of the great actors working today as she
  commands the screen and gives a memorable performance despite the clumsy
  dialogue. Pugh is coming off of her big Marvel release last year,
  <em>Black Widow</em>, where despite a lackluster plot she was able to win over
  crowds and steal the show (sound familiar?). Pugh delivers a dynamic and
  compelling performance that will captivate any audience. Many of the best
  scenes in this film come when Alice is left alone during the day to explore
  her dystopian dream world. We wander along with Alice down the rabbit hole as
  she uncoversthe dystopian world around her. It’s these early moments of
  suspense, discovery, and world building that immerse the audience and promise
  a thrilling conclusion. Sadly, it is a promise that goes unfulfilled.

  The difference between Florence Pugh and Harry Styles’ acting abilities is
  obvious at some points. While Pugh constructs a richly layered performance
  building from the hidden details of her character’s backstory, Styles is
  really just punching it in. The most notable atrocities come when he is seen
  dancing on stage after a promotion and then later when we see incel, ugly
  Harry styles. Harry Styles' acting isn’t necessarily atrocious in and of
  itself, it’s more lackluster. He is playing the male lead yet his delivery
  makes him feel more like a side character. He doesn’t take any risks with his
  performance and in the moments when he is given the spotlight the words feel
  forced and unnatural. Harry Styles is one of the most famous singers in the
  world and seeing him in a movie was somewhat distracting at first. It’s
  amazing how despite his celebrity he still manages to fade into the
  background.

  <em>Don’t Worry Darling</em>’s social commentary rings true in today’s society
  yet it is hardly original. Towards the final 3/4ths of the film it is revealed
  that Alice is being held prisoner by her boyfriend in a virtual reality
  simulation so that her boyfriend can keep her as a glorified sex doll that he
  can come home to. The film comments on how the patriarchal views of the 1950’s
  have not gone away but rather changed. Harry Styles claims he wants the best
  for Alice by forcing her to stop her work as a surgeon and live the life of a
  mid century house wife. In the virtual world he uses childbirth and his work
  to force her into a submissive position, to stay trapped. In the real world,
  he was previously unemployed and used technology to trap her in his dream
  world. It’s a story that hits on societies growing fears of virtual reality
  and the evolution of misogynistic ideals in the future of technology and the
  workplace. I wish they did more with it, but we are only treated to about ten
  minutes of this revelation before the movie goes completely off its hinges and
  nothing makes sense.

<p>
  The biggest reason to not watch this film has to be the plot, specifically the
  unsatisfying ending. There is a big reveal about 20 minutes before the end of
  the film.The twist is actually done really well and comes with a huge shift in
  style and tone before cutting back to their Alice in Wonderland fantasy land.
  The parallels to Alice in Wonderland are also fun to point out and aid in the
  film’s social commentary in a meaningful way, although virtual reality
  parallels to Alice in Wonderland have already been done and in much better
  fashion (<em>The Matrix).</em>

<p>
  Despite the suspenseful twist, the film goes way off the hinges and fails to
  wrap up all the loose ends. The plot devolves into pure confusion for both
  characters and audience viewers as characters kill characters for no obvious
  reason, unnecessary and complicated rules are made up, and everything devolves
  into a big chase scene which ends with a black screen and no explanations. If
  you do choose to watch this movie I would turn it off after the big twist and
  just know you saved yourself some headaches trying to piece anything more
  together.

  After her phenomenal directorial debut <em>Superbad 2</em>, wait sorry I mean
  <em>Booksmart</em>, I was really excited to see Olivia Wilde’s next film. When
  the drama started I figured most of it was just a publicity stunt to generate
  some buzz around the film’s release. A lot of productions start to create buzz
  at the casting nowadays which makes following a movie’s timeline more
  entertaining. After watching the film it’s obvious there were some real
  troubles that contributed to the production and so I think it’s unfair to hold
  this one too much against her as an auteur. If you have to, see it for
  florence", but if not don't see it at all
