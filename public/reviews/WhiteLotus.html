  <em>White Lotus</em>’s flawless character driven storytelling challenges the
  viewers expectations of what drama tv shows can be. The dramedy genre has
  dominated critically acclaimed tv recently. <em>White Lotus</em> fits in
  nicely with shows like <em>Severance</em>, <em>Better Call Saul</em>,
  <em>Ted Lasso</em>, and <em>Barry</em>. However, unlike these shows
  <em>White Lotus</em> lacks any real single overarching coherent narrative and
  doesn’t have a single character that it takes seriously. Make no mistake, the
  characters in <em>White Lotus</em> are some of the deepest, most flushed out
  individuals you will find on tv. They are perfectly imperfect. Conversations
  seem relevant without feeling too pandering and flaws feel real in the
  satirical island resort world. The best characters in entertainment are the
  ones you love to hate and hate to love. Dynamic character’s whose motives are
  sometimes unclear. While we don’t always agree with their decisions we can
  pick apart and pinpoint the origin of their actions. <em>White Lotus </em>is
  simply a masterclass in modern melodrama.

  A common held belief in storytelling is that characters have to change to have
  a cohesive, compelling narrative. Creator and Director Mike White (who you may
  recognize from another project he wrote <em>School of Rock </em>or maybe even
  his appearance as a contestant on <em>Survivor) </em>plays with the idea of
  character change by building a story not about how his characters change but
  rather how their relationships grow and they discover who they really are.
  Many character’s leave their island vacation in the same position they came
  in. Tanya McQuoid, played by the academy award winning Jennifer Coolide, comes
  to the island an unstable grieving mess and leaves as an unstable mess who is
  more self aware and no better a person because of it. It’s frustratingly
  poetic, just like life.

  If you watch it for nothing else please watch it solely for the soundtrack.
  Similar to movies like <em>The Shining </em>and <em>The Graduate</em>,
  <em>White Lotus </em>has a unique, suspenseful, and humorous soundtrack that
  is used meticulously throughout the series. Tonal music permeates through
  dream sequences, polynesian music adds social commentary, and we are treated
  to an absolute banger of a theme song at the beginning of every episode.

  <em>White Lotus</em> offers the viewer so much without demanding them to
  obsess over subtleties. It's the sort of show that you are going to want to
  debate over with your friends, think about before going to sleep, and stay
  thinking about long after the credits roll. To say I am excited for season two
  is an understatement (streaming on HBO max October 30th 2022).
