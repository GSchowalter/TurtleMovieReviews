  Like many of you out there Nathan Fielder has been an obsession of mine for
  quite some time. <em>Nathan for You </em>is one of the most inventive comedic
  works in recent history, he has writing credits on two of Comedy Central’s
  best shows, and his work as a producer in <em>How to with Jon Wilson </em>has
  synonomized his name with absurdist cringe comedy. I would go as far to say
  that he has even created a new sub genre of documentary film. So when I heard
  the long silent Fielder HBO project was coming out soon I quite literally
  marked my calendar. Surely a project from a creator known for large scale,
  outlandish stunts that took (TK input year in production here) years to make
  would deliver like never before, right? Like most things Fielder does, it's
  complicated.
</p>
<p>
  For those of you unfamiliar with Nathan Fielder’s previous show,
  <em>Nathan for You </em>was a comedy central show starring Nathan which
  premiered in 2013 and ended in 2018. Some critics have called it one of the
  best shows of the 2010’s. A typical episode of
  <em>Nathan for You </em>consists of Nathan posing as a business consultant in
  order to “help'' small businesses. His help comes in the form of outlandish
  solutions to made up problems that plunge the business owner and other
  participants into an absurd situation of Nathan’s own creation.
</p>
<p>
  In the episode “Smokers Allowed”Nathan helps a bar by finding a loophole in
  the law that allows customers to legally smoke indoors. The catch is that the
  bar and every customer has to be part of a theatrical production. This evolves
  into Nathan putting up a curtain in a corner of the bar in front of two seats
  and then presenting a casual night in the bar as some sort of avant garde
  theater performance titled “Smokers Allowed”. After surprisingly good reviews
  from the two audience members, Nathan thinks that the play could be a success
  and proceeds to recreate that night at the bar in exact detail. He hires
  actors to play the customers and bartenders and then has them rehearse the
  <del>completely</del> mundane night. Even going as far as to recreate the
  exact layout of the bar that night. A complete diversion from “helping small
  businesses”.
</p>
<p>
  One of the biggest questions I get when showing people
  <em>Nathan for You </em>is “is this fake”. A question to which I always
  responded with a resounding “No”, this is all real, that's what makes it so
  funny. Business consultant“Nathan Fielder” is a character that the real
  comedian writer Nathan plays for the sake of the show in order to generate
  hilarious reactions from people but the reactions and situations themselves
  are all real. <em>Nathan for You </em>shows us what you can get people to do
  when you point a camera at them and in doing so he shows the audience how
  purposefully manipulative reality tv can be not just to their subjects but
  also to the audience.
</p>
<p>
  The character Nathan is a hyper awkward guy who simultaneously has<del
  > </del>outlandish ideas while at the same time being super sensitive about
  how well they work. The host of <em>Nathan for You</em> is self centered and
  egotistical,but in the end all of his crazy ideas work with the show because
  there is an understanding that the character “Nathan Fielder” is exactly that,
  a character. No one would really hire fifteen actors to recreate a mundane
  week night at a dive bar in the hopes of theatrical success. But in
  <em>The Rehearsal</em> this distinction isn’t quite as clear sometimes.
</p>
<p>
  In many ways <em>The Rehearsal</em> is a natural progression of where
  <em>Nathan for You </em>left off. Much like <em>Nathan for You</em>,
  <em>The Rehearsal </em>has a simple yet interesting premise, giving people the
  opportunity to practice for the lives and conversations they want to have but
  are too scared to pursue. The show is narrated by and stars the same self
  indulgent Nathan character that is featured in <em>Nathan for You. </em>Just
  like <em>Nathan for You</em> the premise is stretched and contorted to
  accommodate for the lead character’s own self indulgences. Nathan deceives,
  manipulates, and ultimately pushes his subjects for our entertainment. But
  just like in Nathan for You it’s all in good fun – at least for the first
  episode.
</p>
<p>
  The first episode of the rehearsal is one of the funniest episodes of
  television I have ever watched. The main subject of the episode, Kor, is
  afraid to come clean about a small lie he told his trivia group nine years ago
  about having a masters degree. To most people this seems like a relatively
  small problem but to Kor the guilt this lie has caused is eating away at him.
  Before I go any further I want to preface this by saying I will be spoiling
  much of The<em> Rehersal’s</em> first season which, unlike
  <em>Nathan for You, </em>has a continuous plot between episodes. Nathan helps
  Kor by
</p>
<p>
  The biggest difference between <em>The Rehearsal </em>and
  <em>Nathan for You</em> is the “why”. In <em>Nathan for You </em>Nathan is
  always on a quest, whether it be helping a small business or finding an old
  man’s lost love. Nathan always gives us a reason or a “why” for what he is
  doing. In <em>The Rehearsal </em>there is no “why” for many of the scenes.
  Nathan rehearses scenes that have already happened. This behavior really
  starts midway through the season when Nathan starts to train a group of actors
  using “The Fielder Method” so that he can use them to act in his rehearsals.
  The Fielder method consists of Nathan encouraging these people to basically
  stalk someone with an ordinary job.
</p>
<p>
  To better understand their experiences Nathan starts to… rehearse the classes
  after they happen, becoming a student of his own method. Nathan starts to
  stalk and impersonate one of the students in his classes. Even going so far as
  to obtain his house keys and live life in his apartment as the student stays
  somewhere else on the show’s dime. Its at this point in the series where I
  started to ask myself why? Who has this Nathan character become?
</p>
<p>
  In the past Nathan has always been so sure of his actions. Maybe the character
  of Nathan in a given episode has some manufactured insecurity like insisting
  that a polygraph test is wrong when it calls him a liar or being afraid to
  skydive. But there was always a cushion of humor created by these insecurities
  that gave us the ability to laugh rather than just leave us with this feeling
  of alienation. In <em>The Rehearsal</em> we just watch Nathan stalk this guy
  for seemingly no reason at all. Some parts are funny but the ratio of
  creepiness to humor is way out of proportion.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Nathan for You</em> offers the viewer comfort and safety by letting the
  audience in on the joke, showing them reasons for why they are deceiving the
  subjects. Even in some of the more morally questionable
  <em>Nathan for You</em> sketches (season three episode 6) we as the audience
  are comforted by the fact that what we are seeing is a joke. Nathan is a
  character. <em>The Rehearsal </em>not only refuses to give the viewer the same
  comfort but actively undermines this feeling leading to a sort of uncanniness
  and unnerving experience.
</p>
<p>
  <em>The Rehearsal </em>is more cruel than <em>Nathan for You</em>. One of the
  main subjects of the show Angela is a genuinely extremely dislikable person.
  According to her video responses she posted during the show’s airing, the show
  portrays her accurately which makes her even more hateable as a character. Her
  evangelical judgemental brand of christian spiritualism combined with her
  constant hypocrisy easily makes her the antagonist of the show. But Nathan
  doesn’t provide us with a satisfying comeuppance to resolve her character. In
  the final episode Nathan apologizes to her for how off the rails things had
  gone and Angela actually doubles down and agrees that he should be
  apologizing.
</p>
<p>
  All these feelings of strangeness and lack of purpose is also what makes
  <em>The Rehearsal </em>worth watching. The simple minded Nathan from
  <em>Nathan for You</em> is gone. <em>The Rehearsal </em>Nathan is here and
  he’s not going away. This new Nathan is just like the old Nathan except
  stranger, messier, and realer. There are scenes and dialog in
  <em>The Rehearsal </em>that just aren’t made up. In the now iconic final
  episode of season 1 Nathan is presented with a situation where one of the
  child actors he hired to play his son has now developed a genuine
  understanding that Nathan is indeed his father. Nathan derails his entire
  experiment to deal with this situation through elaborate rehearsals of past
  scenes with the child.
</p>
<p>
  Nathan uses this situation as a means to generate a finally for the show which
  has genuinely lost its course. It’s actually kind of messed up. This kid
  formed a deep connection to Nathan and Nathan uses this for content. It feels
  like something that should be handled off camera rather than becoming the main
  subject of the show. The real Nathan Fielder should be handling this, not the
  character Nathan. But that's exactly his point. The character Nathan and the
  real Nathan aren’t quite as clear cut anymore. Nathan uses the resources of
  his own show to create rehearsals to solve his personal problems.
</p>
<p>
  The final scene of the season depicts Nathan playing the child’s mother and
  another child actor playing the child (TK replace with the child’s name).
  Nathan as the mom rehearses telling the child that Nathan isn’t his father. A
  completely made up scenario that Nathan could never be a part in. In the final
  shot after a long conversation about their experience on the show the child
  says “thanks mom” (tk input exact real quote) Nathan as the mom then says,
  “I’m not your mom, I’m you dad”... Are we watching the psychotic break of a
  comedic mastermind? Probably not.
</p>
<p>
  If I were to venture a theory to the meaning of this scene I would say that
  Nathan is almost trying to make an awkward joke about how the actor who is
  playing the child is supposed to be playing his son at the same time. That
  Nathan is breaking character but only the character that he is playing in that
  scene. Essentially going one layer up back to the character Nathan who is
  rehearsing to be a father in the first place. By breaking character in this
  way Nathan is showing us how deep he’s gone at this point. He has created so
  many layers of reality in between him and real life that it’s hard to keep
  track at this point.
</p>
<p>
  Nathan has said on several occasions that Inception is his favorite movie.
  Like many things it's always hard to tell what is real and what isn’t with
  Nathan but this may in fact point to the fact that this is real. Inception is
  a movie about layers, about not knowing what is real and what isn’t. Just like
  the Rehearsal we end off not knowing what is real and what isn’t I think
  that's what Nathan wants us to walk away with.
</p>
<p>
  There is one scene where Nathan replaces the child actor with a seventeen year
  old actor to play the part of a six year old boy. Watching this scene might be
  the hardest I have laughed at a television show in years. The visual gag of
  watching Nathan play with a fully grown adult like he is a 6 year old boy is
  something else. But if it was real I feel like I would see it more as some
  sort of demented youth kink and Nathan as a some sort of pervert. Nathan’s
  deadpan delivery is so on point that the scene delivers on all fronts. It gets
  me laughing and thinking and that is why you watch.
</p>
<p>
  If a friend were to ask me about <em>The Rehearsal </em>is this real? I would
  tell them the truth and say “I don’t know” and that’s exactly how Nathan wants
  it. I see season one of <em>The Rehearsal </em>as the start of Nathan’s
  departure away from comedy and into artistic film making. Is
  <em>The Rehearsal </em>funny? Absolutely one of the best things you can watch
  today. Is <em>The Rehearsal </em>entertaining? I don’t know but I wouldn’t
  miss it. Would I recommend it to my friends? Depends which friend. I had a
  friend who liked <em>Nathan for You </em>and they asked me if they should
  watch it. I spent the next five minutes warning them about how weird it was
  and then ended up telling them they need to watch it regardless. When pitching
  it to my coworkers to watch I find myself not including any details about the
  show other than the basic premise. So do I really think it’s a good show or am
  I just wrapped up in my infatuation with this Nathan character I have grown so
  fond of. The answer like so many others is I don’t know. One thing I do know
  is that I am excited for season 2. Watch on HBO max now if you think you can
  handle it.
